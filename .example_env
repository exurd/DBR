# Roblox Token:
# THIS PROGRAM DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY GRAB YOUR ROBLOX TOKEN FOR YOU!
# Be careful on scripts that "automatically" find your token;
# it takes one backdoor for your account to be stolen!
#
# DO NOT SHARE THE .ENV FILE TO OTHERS ONCE YOU HAVE PUT YOUR TOKEN IN.
# DOING SO WILL LEAD TO HACKERS STEALING YOUR ACCOUNT!
# IF YOU ACCIDENTALLY LEAK YOUR TOKEN, LOG OUT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO
# INVALIATE THE TOKEN.

# Info on safely getting your token can be found on this page:
